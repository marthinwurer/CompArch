Important files:

	header.mak	for use with 'makemake > Makefile'

	*.asm		sample source programs
	*.obj		sample object programs
	*.out5		sample 520 output files
	*.out7		sample 720 output files

	RUN		script to run k19 against the object files

Test files have the following naming convention:

	handout.asm	sample program from the project specification
	test-*.asm	test a single instruction
	*-i.asm		test indirect addressing
	*-x.asm		test indexed addressing
	*-ix.asm	test indirect indexed addressing

You can create your own object files by using the simple assembler found
in the project's pub directory, /usr/local/dcs/pub/wrc/courses/csci453/k19.
See the README.k19asm file there for details.  Please remember that this
assembler is very simple, and is unlikely to work correctly if given
bad input (e.g., syntax errors in the assembly language code).

The RUN script can be used to test your simulator against any or all of
the supplied test programs.  It will run your simulator against one or
more object files and compare the results against my sample output; if
there are any differences, a difference listing will be generated.

The script can be invoked with zero or more object file names.  If any
names are given, only those files will be tested; if no names are given,
all object files will be tested.

Run the script from inside the directory that contains your simulator.
Here are some example commands:

	./RUN					run against all .obj files
	./RUN test-adda.obj			run only test-adda 
	./RUN test-adda.obj test-subb.obj	run only these two tests
