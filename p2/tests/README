Important files:

	header.mak	for use with 'gmakemake > Makefile'

	*.asm		sample source programs
	*.lst		sample program listings
	*.obj		sample object programs
	*.out		sample output files

	RUN		script to run ./pdp11 against the object files

Test files have the following naming convention:

	handout.asm	sample program from the project specification
	err_*.asm	test program that should generate an error
	mode_*.asm	test program for that addressing mode
	test_*.asm	test a single instruction

I do have a PDP-11 assembler which can be used to create object files,
but the object file generation process is rather cumbersome, so I have
not put the assembler here.  If you want to create your own object
files, send me email and I'll send you some instructions.

The RUN script can be used to test your simulator against any or all of
the supplied test programs.  It will run your simulator against one or
more object files and compare the results against my sample output; if
there are any differences, a difference listing will be generated.

Run the script from inside the directory that contains your simulator.
Here are some example commands:

	RUN					run against all .obj files
	RUN test_add.obj			run only test_add 
	RUN test_add.obj test_sub.obj		run only these two tests
